# MusicCollaborations
This project is designed for network analysis of collaborations between artists and between genres, using Los 40's charts from 2006 to 2024. It leverages the Spotify API to extract relevant information, such as artists' genres. You will find the necessary scripts and datasets to perform the analysis and visualize collaboration networks effectively.
